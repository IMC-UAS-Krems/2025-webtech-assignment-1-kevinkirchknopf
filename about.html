            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Elvis Aaron Presley[a] (January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977) was an American singer and actor. Referred to
                as the "King of Rock and Roll", he is widely regarded as one of the most culturally significant figures
                of the 20th century. Presley's energetic and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a mix
                of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, brought both great
                success and initial controversy.

                Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi; his family moved to Memphis, Tennessee, when he was 13. He
                began his music career in 1954 at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound
                of African-American music to a wider audience. Presley, on guitar and accompanied by lead guitarist
                Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of
                country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of
                Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker,
                who managed him for the rest of his career. Presley's first RCA Victor single, "Heartbreak Hotel", was
                released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the US. Within a year, RCA Victor sold ten
                million Presley singles. With a series of successful television appearances and chart-topping records,
                Presley became the leading figure of the newly popular rock and roll; though his performing style and
                promotion of the then-marginalized sound of African Americans led to him being widely considered a
                threat to the moral well-being of white American youth.

                In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in <e>Love Me Tender</em>. Drafted into military service
                in 1958, he relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially
                successful work. Presley held few concerts, and, guided by Parker, devoted much of the 1960s to making
                Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. Some of Presley's most famous
                films included <em>Jailhouse Rock</em> (1957), <em>Blue Hawaii</em> (1961), and <em>Viva Las Vegas</em>
                (1964). In 1968, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed NBC television comeback special
                <em>Elvis</em>, which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and several highly profitable
                tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world,
                <em>Aloha from Hawaii</em>. Years of substance abuse and unhealthy eating severely compromised his
                health, and Presley died in August 1977 at his Graceland estate at the age of 42.

                Presley is one of the best-selling music artists in history, having sold an estimated 500 million
                records worldwide. He was commercially successful in many genres, including pop, country, rock and roll,
                rockabilly, rhythm and blues, adult contemporary, and gospel. Presley won three Grammy Awards, received
                the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36, and has been posthumously inducted into multiple music
                halls of fame. He holds several records, including the most Recording Industry Association of America
                (RIAA)-certified gold and platinum albums, the most albums charted on the Billboard 200, the most
                number-one albums by a solo artist on the UK Albums Chart, and the most number-one singles by any act on
                the UK Singles Chart. In 2018, Presley was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
